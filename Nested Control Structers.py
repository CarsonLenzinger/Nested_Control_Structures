Program: Average Test Scores

This program asks for the test scores for multiple people and reports the average test score for each portion
'''

num_people = int(input("How many people are taking the test: "))
test_per_person = int(input("How many tests are going to be averaged: "))

for i in range(num_people):
    name = input("Enter your name please: ")
    sum = 0
    for j in range(test_per_person):
        score = int(input("  Enter a score: "))
        sum = sum + score
    average = float(sum) / test_per_person
    print("    Average for " + name + ":" + str(round(average, 2)))



print("\n****************************\n")

Program: ForLoop + WhileLoop

This program will create a For Loop with a While Loop embedded into it
'''

for i in range(4):
    print("Outer For Loop: " + str(i))
    x = 1
    while x >= 0:
        print("     While Loop: " + str(x))
        x = x - 1
